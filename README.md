# Line-Chart-Show-Data-on-Mouseover

Before starting this blog post, let’s learn a bit more about data visualization. If you’re familiar with data analysis, then you must have encountered data visualization. It is a key part of data analysis. In simple terms, Data visualization is when you take raw data and present it visually using graphs, charts, and maps. It enables humans to detect trends and patterns in large data sets without wasting time and also gives meaning to complicated datasets and helps businesses identify the areas that require improvement and attention. With the rise of big data upon us, we need to be able to interpret increasingly larger batches of data in a quicker and more interactive way. We can use BI tools like Tableau, PowerBi, Superset, etc or we can use freely available data visualization libraries like D3.js, Highcharts, etc. D3.js is the default standard in data visualization libraries. In this blog post, I’ll be discussing more on interactivity in D3.js, specifically mouse events and how can you subscribe to and use these events in D3.

This blog is a continuation of my previous blog post, if you haven’t checked it yet, I would highly recommend going through the below-mentioned blog post before applying this concept.
